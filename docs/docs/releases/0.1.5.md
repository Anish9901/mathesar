# Mathesar 0.1.5

## Summary

Mathesar 0.1.5 is a small, bug fix release.

_This page provides a comprehensive list of all changes in the release._

## Upgrading to Mathesar 0.1.5

### For installations using Docker Compose

If you have a Docker compose installation (including one from the guided script), run the command below:

⚠️ You may need to change `/etc/mathesar/` in this command if you chose to install Mathesar to a different directory.

```
docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up \
  --force-recreate --build service
```

### For installations done from scratch

If you installed from scratch, the upgrade instructions are the same as [for 0.1.4](../../administration/upgrade/0.1.4/#scratch), but you can skip Step 5 – you do not need to change the environment variables.
