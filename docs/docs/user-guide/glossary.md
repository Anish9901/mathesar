#### User Database {:#user-db}

Mathesar is a tool that helps the user manage the data. Databases which contain these data are called as the user database

#### Internal Database {:#internal-db}

Mathesar, in addition to providing a UI for the [User Database](#user-db) also provides additional features like column ordering, display options to make it easier for managing the data. Since these data are specific to Mathesar, we store them in a separate database. This database is referred to as the Internal Database.
