# Mathesar's Role-Based Permissions

Mathesar uses [PostgreSQL roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/user-manag.html) to manage permissions within a database. These roles define the actions users can perform, allowing fine-grained control over access.

## Roles vs Users

Each Mathesar user accesses a database through one PostgreSQL role â€” and the user's permissions are determined by the _role's_ permissions within PostgreSQL.

You can read more about [how users and roles work together](./users.md#users-vs-roles).

## Database Settings

Mathesar provides three main sections for role management within the database settings:

### In Mathesar

These configurations specifically control how you interact with the database within the Mathesar interface.

- **Role Configuration**: Used to manage credentials (passwords) for roles that exist on the server. These roles can then be assigned to collaborators.
- **Collaborators**: This section enables you to manage user access to the database. You can add existing Mathesar users as collaborators and assign them configured roles, which determine their specific access levels and permissions within the database.

### On the Server

These configurations affect the underlying PostgreSQL server where your database lives.

- **Roles**: Here you can manage roles available on the server, defining their inheritance, creating new roles, or deleting existing ones.

!!! note
    Changes to this configuration will be reflected in all databases on the server.

### Role Configuration

In the **Role Configuration** section, all [LOGIN roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/role-attributes.html#ROLE-ATTRIBUTES) that exist on the server are listed. These roles can then be assigned to collaborators once configured. A configured role has a password set.

- **Configure Password**: For each role, you can configure or change the password directly within Mathesar.
- **Remove Role**: You can remove role configurations from Mathesar as needed. This only removes the configured credentials (password), not the role from the server.

### Collaborators

Collaborators are existing Mathesar users who have been added to work on a database. Each collaborator is assigned a PostgreSQL LOGIN role that dictates their level of access to the database and its objects (schemas, tables, etc.).

- **Add Collaborators**: In the **Collaborators** section, you can add existing Mathesar users as collaborators to the database. When adding a collaborator, you assign them one of the roles that have been configured in Mathesar.

- **Remove Collaborator**: You can remove a collaborator if they no longer require access to the database. The Mathesar user will still exist, and you can add them back as a collaborator at a later time.

### Server Roles

The **Roles** section, found under the **Settings** tab, shows the roles available on the PostgreSQL server of the connected database.

These roles are displayed for all databases on the server, and any changes made to a server role will be reflected across all databases on the server.

- **Create Roles**: You can create new server-level roles from this section. You can configure these roles in two ways:
    1. With login capability and a password, which you can assign to collaborators.
    2. Without login capability, to be used exclusively as a parent role to group permissions that can be inherited by other roles. You cannot assign these non-login roles to collaborators directly.
- **Define Child Roles**: PostgreSQL has a mechanism for [Role Membership](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/role-membership.html) wherein any role can be "granted" to any other role to form simple hierarchies or complex graph-based inheritance structures. For any role you've configured within Mathesar, you can use Mathesar to grant the role to other "child roles".
- **Drop Roles**: You can drop server-level roles that are no longer needed. This action removes the role from the server, however if the role is configured in Mathesar, it will still be displayed. Exercise caution when dropping roles, as it may affect collaborators using the dropped role in Mathesar.

!!! note
    Server roles, once added, must be configured in Mathesar under the **Role Configuration** section before they can be assigned to collaborators.

## Permissions Management at Different Levels

Mathesar provides an interface to manage permissions at different levels in the underlying PostgreSQL database:

1. **Database Level:** Accessible from the database page.
2. **Schema Level:** Accessible from the schema page.
3. **Table Level:** Accessible from the inspector panel for each table.

### Ownership of Objects

When a new object (database, schema, or table) is created, the owner of the object is the configured role that the collaborator uses to create it. This automatic ownership assignment allows the role to have immediate and administrative control over the objects created under it, including the ability to manage permissions and transfer ownership if needed.

### Database Permissions

Database permissions control access and actions at the database level.

- **Owner**: Each database has an owner who has administrative control over the database itself, including managing database-level permissions and transferring ownership. Ownership does not automatically extend to the objects within the database (such as schemas and tables), which may have their own separate ownership and permission settings.
- **Granted Access**: Specific permissions can be granted to roles for various actions within the database.
- **Transfer Ownership**: The current owner can transfer ownership to another role, granting them administrative control.

For each database, the following permission levels can be granted:

- **Connect**: Allows the role to access and connect to the database.
- **Create**: Includes Connect permissions and allows the role to create new schemas within the database.
- **Custom**: Enables the granular setting of permissions beyond the predefined options.

### Schema Permissions

Schema permissions control access and actions at the schema level.

- **Owner**: Each schema has an owner who has administrative control over the schema itself, including managing schema-level permissions and transferring ownership. Ownership does not automatically extend to the objects within the schema (such as tables), which may have their own separate ownership and permission settings.
- **Granted Access**: Specific permissions can be granted to roles for various actions within the schema.
- **Transfer Ownership**: The current owner can transfer ownership to another role, granting them administrative control over the schema.

For each schema, the following permission levels can be granted:

- **Read**: Allows the role to access the schema and view its objects.
- **Create**: Includes Read permissions and allows the role to create new tables within the schema.
- **Custom**: Enables the granular setting of permissions beyond the predefined options.

### Table Permissions

Table permissions control access and actions at the table level.

- **Owner**: Each table has an owner who has administrative control over the table itself, including managing table-level permissions, transferring ownership, and modifying the table's structure (such as adding, removing, or altering columns).
- **Granted Access**: Specific permissions can be granted to roles for various actions on the table.
- **Transfer Ownership**: The current owner can transfer ownership to another role, granting them administrative control over the table.

For each table, the following permission levels can be granted:

- **Read**: Allows the role to access the table and read records.
- **Write**: Includes Read permissions and allows the role to insert, update, and delete records in the table.
- **Custom**: Enables the granular setting of permissions beyond the predefined options.

You can read more on custom permissions and the specific privileges that can be granted on the [PostgreSQL GRANT documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html).
