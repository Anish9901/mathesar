# REST API

Mathesar has a REST API that the front end uses to interact with the backend.

For Mathesar's beta release, we are actively transitioning to a new [RPC-style API](https://wiki.mathesar.org/projects/2024/architecture-transition/rpc/) and will soon be phasing out the REST API entirely.

The REST API is not documented and is not intended to be used by third-party developers.
